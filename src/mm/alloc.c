/* This file is concerned with allocating and freeing arbitrary-size blocks of
 * physical memory on behalf of the FORK and EXEC system calls.  The key data
 * structure used is the hole table, which maintains a list of holes in memory.
 * It is kept sorted in order of increasing memory address. The addresses
 * it contains refer to physical memory, starting at absolute address 0
 * (i.e., they are not relative to the start of MM).  During system
 * initialization, that part of memory containing the interrupt vectors,
 * kernel, and MM are "allocated" to mark them as not available and to
 * remove them from the hole list.
 *
 * The entry points into this file are:
 *   alloc_mem:	allocate a given sized chunk of memory
 *   free_mem:	release a previously allocated chunk of memory
 *   mem_init:	initialize the tables when MM start up
 *   max_hole:	returns the largest hole currently available
